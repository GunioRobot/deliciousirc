irclicious.py
=============

Depends
-------
- urwid http://excess.org/urwid/ 
- deliciousapi http://www.michael-noll.com/wiki/Del.icio.us_Python_API

Install
-------

This is a preliminary version, just drop ircilicious.py and the config file
somewhere (I put it in ``~/bin/``).

Running ircilicious
-------------------
Edit the ``irciliciousrc`` config file and put your ``delicious.com``
credentials in it, then ``chmod`` accordingly.

Irc log files should follow this format::

	21:07 < nick> howdy
	21:08 < nick> great http://github.com/dzen/deliciousirc/ #delicious, irc#
	21:09 -!- nick [n=someone@domain.org] has quit [Remote closed the connection]

If your logs are different, choose:
- sed is your friend
- edit ircilicious.py and adapt the regex ``lutin`` around line 102 

Then::

	$ python irclicious.py nomdufichierdelog

Here, ``ircilicious.py`` would propose the
``http://github.com/dzen/deliciousirc/`` URL with ``nick, delicious, irc`` tags
in an ``ncurses`` interface. You might then view the page with your default
browser, retag it if you feel like it, and post it to delicious.

In addition, you may "scrap" it, meaning that the *domain* (not the URL) would
be added to the ``crap.txt`` file, and irclicious.py would never propose URL
from that domain again.

Have fun !
