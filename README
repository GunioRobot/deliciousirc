irclicious.py
=============

Depends
-------
- urwid http://excess.org/urwid/ 
- pydelicious http://code.google.com/p/pydelicious/

Install
-------

This is a preliminary version, just drop ircilicious.py and the config file
somewhere (I put it in ``~/bin/``).

Running ircilicious
-------------------
Edit the ``ircilicious.yml`` config file and put your ``delicious.com``
credentials in it, then ``chmod`` accordingly.

Configuration
-------------

the configuration is a yaml file so that's a key/value list so take a look at:
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml
or
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml

here is a configuration sample:

----- %< -------
--- #YAML:1.1

login: delicioususer
pass: deliciouspassword

exclude_tags:
    - notag
    - enotag
    - osef


scraplist: 'crap.txt'


----- >% -------

	21:07 < nick> howdy
	21:08 < nick> great http://github.com/dzen/deliciousirc/ #delicious, irc#
	21:09 -!- nick [n=someone@domain.org] has quit [Remote closed the connection]

If your logs are different, choose:
- sed is your friend
- edit ircilicious.py and adapt the regex ``lutin`` around line 102 

Then::

	$ python irclicious.py nomdufichierdelog

Here, ``ircilicious.py`` would propose the
``http://github.com/dzen/deliciousirc/`` URL with ``nick, delicious, irc`` tags
in an ``ncurses`` interface. You might then view the page with your default
browser, retag it if you feel like it, and post it to delicious.

In addition, you may "scrap" it, meaning that the *domain* (not the URL) would
be added to the ``crap.txt`` file, and irclicious.py would never propose URL
from that domain again.

Have fun !
